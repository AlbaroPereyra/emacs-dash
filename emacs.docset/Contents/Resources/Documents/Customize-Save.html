<h4 class="subsection">18.3.3 Customizing Saving of Files</h4>

<p><a name="index-require_002dfinal_002dnewline-1044"></a>  If the value of the variable <code>require-final-newline</code> is
<code>t</code>, saving or writing a file silently puts a newline at the end
if there isn't already one there.  If the value is <code>visit</code>, Emacs
adds a newline at the end of any file that doesn't have one, just
after it visits the file.  (This marks the buffer as modified, and you
can undo it.)  If the value is <code>visit-save</code>, Emacs adds such
newlines both on visiting and on saving.  If the value is <code>nil</code>,
Emacs leaves the end of the file unchanged; any other non-<code>nil</code>
value means to asks you whether to add a newline.  The default is
<code>nil</code>.

   <p><a name="index-mode_002drequire_002dfinal_002dnewline-1045"></a>  Some major modes are designed for specific kinds of files that are
always supposed to end in newlines.  Such major modes set the variable
<code>require-final-newline</code> to the value of
<code>mode-require-final-newline</code>, which defaults to <code>t</code>.  By
setting the latter variable, you can control how these modes handle
final newlines.

   <p><a name="index-write_002dregion_002dinhibit_002dfsync-1046"></a>  When Emacs saves a file, it invokes the <code>fsync</code> system call to
force the data immediately out to disk.  This is important for safety
if the system crashes or in case of power outage.  However, it can be
disruptive on laptops using power saving, as it may force a disk
spin-up each time you save a file.  If you accept an increased risk of
data loss, you can set <code>write-region-inhibit-fsync</code> to a
non-<code>nil</code> value to disable the synchronization.

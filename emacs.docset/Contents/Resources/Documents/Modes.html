<h2 class="chapter">23 Major and Minor Modes</h2>

<p>Emacs contains many <dfn>editing modes</dfn> that alter its basic
behavior in useful ways.  These are divided into <dfn>major modes</dfn> and
<dfn>minor modes</dfn>.

   <p>Major modes provide specialized facilities for working on a
particular file type, such as a C source file (see <a href="Programs.html#Programs">Programs</a>), or a
particular type of non-file buffer, such as a shell buffer
(see <a href="Shell.html#Shell">Shell</a>).  Major modes are mutually exclusive; each buffer has
one and only one major mode at any time.

   <p>Minor modes are optional features which you can turn on or off, not
necessarily specific to a type of file or buffer.  For example, Auto
Fill mode is a minor mode in which &lt;SPC&gt; breaks lines between
words as you type (see <a href="Auto-Fill.html#Auto-Fill">Auto Fill</a>).  Minor modes are independent of
one another, and of the selected major mode.

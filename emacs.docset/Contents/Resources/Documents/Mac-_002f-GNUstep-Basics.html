<h3 class="section">F.1 Basic Emacs usage under Mac OS and GNUstep</h3>

<p>By default, the &lt;alt&gt; and &lt;option&gt; keys are the same as
&lt;Meta&gt;.  The Mac &lt;Cmd&gt; key is the same as &lt;Super&gt;, and
Emacs provides a set of key bindings using this modifier key that mimic
other Mac / GNUstep applications (see <a href="Mac-_002f-GNUstep-Events.html#Mac-_002f-GNUstep-Events">Mac / GNUstep Events</a>).  You
can change these bindings in the usual way (see <a href="Key-Bindings.html#Key-Bindings">Key Bindings</a>).

<!-- FIXME mention ns-alternate-modifier? -->
   <p>The variable <code>ns-right-alternate-modifier</code> controls the
behavior of the right &lt;alt&gt; and &lt;option&gt; keys.  These keys
behave like the left-hand keys if the value is <code>left</code> (the
default).  A value of <code>control</code>, <code>meta</code>, <code>alt</code>,
<code>super</code>, or <code>hyper</code> makes them behave like the corresponding
modifier keys; a value of <code>none</code> tells Emacs to ignore them.

   <p><kbd>S-Mouse-1</kbd> adjusts the region to the click position,
just like <kbd>Mouse-3</kbd> (<code>mouse-save-then-kill</code>); it does not pop
up a menu for changing the default face, as <kbd>S-Mouse-1</kbd> normally
does (see <a href="Text-Scale.html#Text-Scale">Text Scale</a>).  This change makes Emacs behave more like
other Mac / GNUstep applications.

   <p>When you open or save files using the menus, or using the
<kbd>Cmd-o</kbd> and <kbd>Cmd-S</kbd> bindings, Emacs uses graphical file
dialogs to read file names.  However, if you use the regular Emacs key
sequences, such as <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd>, Emacs uses the minibuffer to read
file names.

   <p>On GNUstep, in an X-windows environment you need to use <kbd>Cmd-c</kbd>
instead of one of the <kbd>C-w</kbd> or <kbd>M-w</kbd> commands to transfer text
to the X primary selection; otherwise, Emacs will use the
&ldquo;clipboard&rdquo; selection.  Likewise, <kbd>Cmd-y</kbd> (instead of <kbd>C-y</kbd>)
yanks from the X primary selection instead of the kill-ring or
clipboard.

<h4 class="subsection">F.1.1 Grabbing environment variables</h4>

<!-- How is this any different to launching from a window manager menu -->
<!-- in GNU/Linux?  These are sometimes not login shells either. -->
<p>Many programs which may run under Emacs, like latex or man, depend on the
settings of environment variables.  If Emacs is launched from the shell, it
will automatically inherit these environment variables and its subprocesses
will inherit them from it.  But if Emacs is launched from the Finder it
is not a descendant of any shell, so its environment variables haven't been
set, which often causes the subprocesses it launches to behave differently than
they would when launched from the shell.

   <p>For the PATH and MANPATH variables, a system-wide method
of setting PATH is recommended on Mac OS X 10.5 and later, using the
<samp><span class="file">/etc/paths</span></samp> files and the <samp><span class="file">/etc/paths.d</span></samp> directory.

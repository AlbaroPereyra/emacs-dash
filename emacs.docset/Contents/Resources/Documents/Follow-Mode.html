  <dfn>Follow mode</dfn> is a minor mode that makes two windows, both
showing the same buffer, scroll as a single tall &ldquo;virtual window&rdquo;. 
To use Follow mode, go to a frame with just one window, split it into
two side-by-side windows using <kbd>C-x 3</kbd>, and then type <kbd>M-x
follow-mode</kbd>.  From then on, you can edit the buffer in either of the
two windows, or scroll either one; the other window follows it.

   <p>In Follow mode, if you move point outside the portion visible in one
window and into the portion visible in the other window, that selects
the other window&mdash;again, treating the two as if they were parts of
one large window.

   <p>To turn off Follow mode, type <kbd>M-x follow-mode</kbd> a second time.

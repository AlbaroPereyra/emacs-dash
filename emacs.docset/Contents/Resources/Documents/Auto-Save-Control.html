<h4 class="subsection">18.6.2 Controlling Auto-Saving</h4>

<p><a name="index-auto_002dsave_002ddefault-1080"></a><a name="index-auto_002dsave_002dmode-1081"></a>  Each time you visit a file, auto-saving is turned on for that file's
buffer if the variable <code>auto-save-default</code> is non-<code>nil</code> (but
not in batch mode; see <a href="Initial-Options.html#Initial-Options">Initial Options</a>).  The default for this
variable is <code>t</code>, so auto-saving is the usual practice for
file-visiting buffers.  To toggle auto-saving in the current buffer,
type <kbd>M-x auto-save-mode</kbd>.  Auto Save mode acts as a buffer-local
minor mode (see <a href="Minor-Modes.html#Minor-Modes">Minor Modes</a>).

   <p><a name="index-auto_002dsave_002dinterval-1082"></a>  Emacs auto-saves periodically based on how many characters you have
typed since the last auto-save.  The variable
<code>auto-save-interval</code> specifies how many characters there are
between auto-saves.  By default, it is 300.  Emacs doesn't accept
values that are too small: if you customize <code>auto-save-interval</code>
to a value less than 20, Emacs will behave as if the value is 20.

   <p><a name="index-auto_002dsave_002dtimeout-1083"></a>  Auto-saving also takes place when you stop typing for a while.  By
default, it does this after 30 seconds of idleness (at this time,
Emacs may also perform garbage collection; see <a href="../elisp/Garbage-Collection.html#Garbage-Collection">Garbage Collection</a>).  To change
this interval, customize the variable <code>auto-save-timeout</code>.  The
actual time period is longer if the current buffer is long; this is a
heuristic which aims to keep out of your way when you are editing long
buffers, in which auto-save takes an appreciable amount of time. 
Auto-saving during idle periods accomplishes two things: first, it
makes sure all your work is saved if you go away from the terminal for
a while; second, it may avoid some auto-saving while you are actually
typing.

   <p>Emacs also does auto-saving whenever it gets a fatal error.  This
includes killing the Emacs job with a shell command such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">kill
%emacs</span></samp>&rsquo;, or disconnecting a phone line or network connection.

   <p><a name="index-do_002dauto_002dsave-1084"></a>  You can perform an auto-save explicitly with the command <kbd>M-x
do-auto-save</kbd>.

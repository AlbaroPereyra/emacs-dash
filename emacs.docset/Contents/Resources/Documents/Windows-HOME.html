<h3 class="section">G.5 HOME and Startup Directories on MS-Windows</h3>

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bHOME_007d-directory-on-MS_002dWindows-4716"></a>
  The Windows equivalent of <code>HOME</code> is the <dfn>user-specific
application data directory</dfn>.  The actual location depends on the
Windows version; typical values are <samp><span class="file">C:\Documents and
Settings\</span><var>username</var><span class="file">\Application Data</span></samp> on Windows 2000/XP/2K3,
<samp><span class="file">C:\Users\</span><var>username</var><span class="file">\AppData\Roaming</span></samp> on Windows
Vista/7/2008, and either <samp><span class="file">C:\WINDOWS\Application Data</span></samp> or
<samp><span class="file">C:\WINDOWS\Profiles\</span><var>username</var><span class="file">\Application Data</span></samp> on Windows
9X/ME.  If this directory does not exist or cannot be accessed, Emacs
falls back to <samp><span class="file">C:\</span></samp> as the default value of <code>HOME</code>.

   <p>You can override this default value of <code>HOME</code> by explicitly
setting the environment variable <samp><span class="env">HOME</span></samp> to point to any directory
on your system.  <samp><span class="env">HOME</span></samp> can be set either from the command shell
prompt or from &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Properties</span></samp>&rsquo; dialog of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">My Computer</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
<code>HOME</code> can also be set in the system registry,
see <a href="MS_002dWindows-Registry.html#MS_002dWindows-Registry">MS-Windows Registry</a>.

   <p>For compatibility with older versions of Emacs<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>, if there is a file named <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> in <samp><span class="file">C:\</span></samp>, the root
directory of drive <samp><span class="file">C:</span></samp>, and <samp><span class="env">HOME</span></samp> is set neither in the
environment nor in the Registry, Emacs will treat <samp><span class="file">C:\</span></samp> as the
default <code>HOME</code> location, and will not look in the application
data directory, even if it exists.  Note that only <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> is
looked for in <samp><span class="file">C:\</span></samp>; the older name <samp><span class="file">_emacs</span></samp> (see below) is
not.  This use of <samp><span class="file">C:\.emacs</span></samp> to define <code>HOME</code> is
deprecated.

   <p>Whatever the final place is, Emacs sets the internal value of the
<samp><span class="env">HOME</span></samp> environment variable to point to it, and it will use that
location for other files and directories it normally looks for or
creates in your home directory.

   <p>You can always find out what Emacs thinks is your home directory's
location by typing <kbd>C-x d ~/ &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.  This should present the
list of files in the home directory, and show its full name on the
first line.  Likewise, to visit your init file, type <kbd>C-x C-f
~/.emacs &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> (assuming the file's name is <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp>).

   <p><a name="index-init-file-_0040file_007b_002eemacs_007d-on-MS_002dWindows-4717"></a>  The home directory is where your init file is stored.  It can have
any name mentioned in <a href="Init-File.html#Init-File">Init File</a>.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040file_007b_005femacs_007d-init-file_002c-MS_002dWindows-4718"></a>  Because MS-DOS does not allow file names with leading dots, and
older Windows systems made it hard to create files with such names,
the Windows port of Emacs supports an init file name <samp><span class="file">_emacs</span></samp>, if
such a file exists in the home directory and <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> does not. 
This name is considered obsolete.

Older versions of Emacs didn't check the application data directory.

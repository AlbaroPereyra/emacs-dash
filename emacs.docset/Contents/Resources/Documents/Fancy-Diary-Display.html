<h4 class="subsection">31.15.8 Fancy Diary Display</h4>

<p>The following features only work with the fancy diary display.

   <p><a name="index-sorting-diary-entries-3501"></a>  You can use the normal hook <code>diary-list-entries-hook</code> to sort
each day's diary entries by their time of day.  Here's how:

   <p><a name="index-diary_002dsort_002dentries-3502"></a>
<pre class="example">     (add-hook 'diary-list-entries-hook 'diary-sort-entries t)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">For each day, this sorts diary entries that begin with a recognizable
time of day according to their times.  Diary entries without times come
first within each day.  Note how the sort command is placed at the end
of the hook list, in case earlier members of the list change the order
of the diary entries, or add items.

   <p><a name="index-diary_002dcomment_002dstart-3503"></a>  You can write &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">comments</span></samp>&rsquo; in diary entries, by setting the
variables <code>diary-comment-start</code> and <code>diary-comment-end</code> to
strings that delimit comments.  The fancy display does not print
comments.  You might want to put meta-data for the use of other packages
(e.g., the appointment package,
see <a href="Appointments.html#Appointments">Appointments</a>)
inside comments.

   <p><a name="index-diary_002dinclude_002dstring-3504"></a>  Your main diary file can include other files.  This permits a group of
people to share a diary file for events that apply to all of them. 
Lines in the diary file starting with <code>diary-include-string</code>:

<pre class="smallexample">     #include "<var>filename</var>"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">include the diary entries from the file <var>filename</var> in the fancy
diary buffer.  The include mechanism is recursive, so that included
files can include other files, and so on (you must be careful not to
have a cycle of inclusions, of course).  Here is how to enable the
include facility:

   <p><a name="index-diary_002dlist_002dentries_002dhook-3505"></a><a name="index-diary_002dmark_002dentries_002dhook-3506"></a><a name="index-diary_002dinclude_002dother_002ddiary_002dfiles-3507"></a><a name="index-diary_002dmark_002dincluded_002ddiary_002dfiles-3508"></a>
<pre class="smallexample">     (add-hook 'diary-list-entries-hook 'diary-include-other-diary-files)
     (add-hook 'diary-mark-entries-hook 'diary-mark-included-diary-files)
</pre>
   <p>The include mechanism works only with the fancy diary display, because
simple diary display shows the entries directly from your diary file.

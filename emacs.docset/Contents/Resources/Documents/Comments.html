<h3 class="section">26.5 Manipulating Comments</h3>

<p><a name="index-comments-2316"></a>
  Because comments are such an important part of programming, Emacs
provides special commands for editing and inserting comments.  It can
also do spell checking on comments with Flyspell Prog mode
(see <a href="Spelling.html#Spelling">Spelling</a>).

   <p>Some major modes have special rules for indenting different kinds of
comments.  For example, in Lisp code, comments starting with two
semicolons are indented as if they were lines of code, while those
starting with three semicolons are supposed to be aligned to the left
margin and are often used for sectioning purposes.  Emacs understand
these conventions; for instance, typing &lt;TAB&gt; on a comment line
will indent the comment to the appropriate position.

<pre class="example">     ;; This function is just an example.
     ;;; Here either two or three semicolons are appropriate.
     (defun foo (x)
     ;;;  And now, the first part of the function:
       ;; The following line adds one.
       (1+ x))           ; This line adds one.
</pre>

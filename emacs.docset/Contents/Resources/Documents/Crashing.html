<h3 class="section">50.6 When Emacs Crashes</h3>

<p><a name="index-crash-report-4466"></a>  Emacs is not supposed to crash, but if it does, it produces a
<dfn>crash report</dfn> prior to exiting.  The crash report is printed to
the standard error stream.  If Emacs was started from a graphical
desktop, the standard error stream is commonly redirected to a file
such as <samp><span class="file">~/.xsession-errors</span></samp>, so you can look for the crash
report there.

   <p>The format of the crash report depends on the platform.  On some
platforms, such as those using the GNU C Library, the crash report
includes a <dfn>backtrace</dfn> describing the execution state prior to
crashing, which can be used to help debug the crash.  Here is an
example:

<pre class="example">     Fatal error 11: Segmentation fault
     Backtrace:
     emacs[0x5094e4]
     emacs[0x4ed3e6]
     emacs[0x4ed504]
     /lib64/libpthread.so.0[0x375220efe0]
     /lib64/libpthread.so.0(read+0xe)[0x375220e08e]
     emacs[0x509af6]
     emacs[0x5acc26]
     ...
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The number &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">11</span></samp>&rsquo; is the system signal number corresponding to the
crash&mdash;in this case a segmentation fault.  The hexadecimal numbers
are program addresses, which can be associated with source code lines
using a debugging tool.  For example, the GDB command
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">list *0x509af6</span></samp>&rsquo; prints the source-code lines corresponding to
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">emacs[0x509af6]</span></samp>&rsquo; entry.  If your system has the
<samp><span class="command">addr2line</span></samp> utility, the following shell command outputs a
backtrace with source-code line numbers:

<pre class="example">     sed -n 's/.*\[\(.*\)]$/\1/p' <var>backtrace</var> |
       addr2line -C -f -i -e <var>bindir</var>/emacs
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Here, <var>backtrace</var> is the name of a text file containing a copy of
the backtrace, and <var>bindir</var> is the name of the directory that
contains the Emacs executable.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>

   <p><a name="index-core-dump-4467"></a>  Optionally, Emacs can generate a <dfn>core dump</dfn> when it crashes.  A
core dump is a file containing voluminous data about the state of the
program prior to the crash, usually examined by loading it into a
debugger such as GDB.  On many platforms, core dumps are disabled by
default, and you must explicitly enable them by running the shell
command &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ulimit -c unlimited</span></samp>&rsquo; (e.g., in your shell startup
script).

   <div class="footnote">
<hr>
<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> You may wish to add the
<samp><span class="option">-p</span></samp> option, if your version of <samp><span class="command">addr2line</span></samp> supports it.</p>

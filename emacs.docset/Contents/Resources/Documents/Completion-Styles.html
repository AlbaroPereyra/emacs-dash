<h4 class="subsection">8.4.4 How Completion Alternatives Are Chosen</h4>

<p><a name="index-completion-style-211"></a>
  Completion commands work by narrowing a large list of possible
completion alternatives to a smaller subset that &ldquo;matches&rdquo; what you
have typed in the minibuffer.  In <a href="Completion-Example.html#Completion-Example">Completion Example</a>, we gave a
simple example of such matching.  The procedure of determining what
constitutes a &ldquo;match&rdquo; is quite intricate.  Emacs attempts to offer
plausible completions under most circumstances.

   <p>Emacs performs completion using one or more <dfn>completion
styles</dfn>&mdash;sets of criteria for matching minibuffer text to completion
alternatives.  During completion, Emacs tries each completion style in
turn.  If a style yields one or more matches, that is used as the list
of completion alternatives.  If a style produces no matches, Emacs
falls back on the next style.

   <p><a name="index-completion_002dstyles-212"></a>  The list variable <code>completion-styles</code> specifies the completion
styles to use.  Each list element is the name of a completion style (a
Lisp symbol).  The default completion styles are (in order):

     <dl>
<dt><code>basic</code><dd>A matching completion alternative must have the same beginning as the
text in the minibuffer before point.  Furthermore, if there is any
text in the minibuffer after point, the rest of the completion
alternative must contain that text as a substring.

     <p><a name="index-partial-completion-213"></a><br><dt><code>partial-completion</code><dd>This aggressive completion style divides the minibuffer text into
words separated by hyphens or spaces, and completes each word
separately.  (For example, when completing command names,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">em-l-m</span></samp>&rsquo; completes to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">emacs-lisp-mode</span></samp>&rsquo;.)

     <p>Furthermore, a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; in the minibuffer text is treated as a
<dfn>wildcard</dfn>&mdash;it matches any character at the corresponding
position in the completion alternative.

     <br><dt><code>emacs22</code><dd>This completion style is similar to <code>basic</code>, except that it
ignores the text in the minibuffer after point.  It is so-named
because it corresponds to the completion behavior in Emacs 22. 
</dl>

<p class="noindent">The following additional completion styles are also defined, and you
can add them to <code>completion-styles</code> if you wish
(see <a href="Customization.html#Customization">Customization</a>):

     <dl>
<dt><code>substring</code><dd>A matching completion alternative must contain the text in the
minibuffer before point, and the text in the minibuffer after point,
as substrings (in that same order).

     <p>Thus, if the text in the minibuffer is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foobar</span></samp>&rsquo;, with point
between &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">bar</span></samp>&rsquo;, that matches
&lsquo;<samp><var>a</var><span class="samp">foo</span><var>b</var><span class="samp">bar</span><var>c</var></samp>&rsquo;, where <var>a</var>, <var>b</var>, and
<var>c</var> can be any string including the empty string.

     <br><dt><code>initials</code><dd>This very aggressive completion style attempts to complete acronyms
and initialisms.  For example, when completing command names, it
matches &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">lch</span></samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">list-command-history</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
</dl>

<p class="noindent">There is also a very simple completion style called <code>emacs21</code>. 
In this style, if the text in the minibuffer is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foobar</span></samp>&rsquo;,
only matches starting with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foobar</span></samp>&rsquo; are considered.

   <p><a name="index-completion_002dcategory_002doverrides-214"></a>You can use different completion styles in different situations,
by setting the variable <code>completion-category-overrides</code>. 
For example, the default setting says to use only <code>basic</code>
and <code>substring</code> completion for buffer names.

<h4 class="subsection">15.1.2 Repeating Incremental Search</h4>

<p>Suppose you search forward for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">FOO</span></samp>&rsquo; and find a match, but not
the one you expected to find: the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">FOO</span></samp>&rsquo; you were aiming for
occurs later in the buffer.  In this event, type another <kbd>C-s</kbd> to
move to the next occurrence of the search string.  You can repeat this
any number of times.  If you overshoot, you can cancel some <kbd>C-s</kbd>
characters with &lt;DEL&gt;.  Similarly, each <kbd>C-r</kbd> in a backward
incremental search repeats the backward search.

   <p><a name="index-lazy-search-highlighting-794"></a><a name="index-isearch_002dlazy_002dhighlight-795"></a>  If you pause for a little while during incremental search, Emacs
highlights all the other possible matches for the search string that
are present on the screen.  This helps you anticipate where you can
get to by typing <kbd>C-s</kbd> or <kbd>C-r</kbd> to repeat the search.  The
other matches are highlighted differently from the current match,
using the customizable face <code>lazy-highlight</code> (see <a href="Faces.html#Faces">Faces</a>).  If
you don't like this feature, you can disable it by setting
<code>isearch-lazy-highlight</code> to <code>nil</code>.

   <p>After exiting a search, you can search for the same string again by
typing just <kbd>C-s C-s</kbd>.  The first <kbd>C-s</kbd> is the key that
invokes incremental search, and the second <kbd>C-s</kbd> means &ldquo;search
again&rdquo;.  Similarly, <kbd>C-r C-r</kbd> searches backward for the last
search string.  In determining the last search string, it doesn't
matter whether the string was searched for with <kbd>C-s</kbd> or
<kbd>C-r</kbd>.

   <p>If you are searching forward but you realize you were looking for
something before the starting point, type <kbd>C-r</kbd> to switch to a
backward search, leaving the search string unchanged.  Similarly,
<kbd>C-s</kbd> in a backward search switches to a forward search.

   <p>If a search is failing and you ask to repeat it by typing another
<kbd>C-s</kbd>, it starts again from the beginning of the buffer. 
Repeating a failing reverse search with <kbd>C-r</kbd> starts again from
the end.  This is called <dfn>wrapping around</dfn>, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Wrapped</span></samp>&rsquo;
appears in the search prompt once this has happened.  If you keep on
going past the original starting point of the search, it changes to
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Overwrapped</span></samp>&rsquo;, which means that you are revisiting matches that
you have already seen.

   <p><a name="index-search-ring-796"></a><a name="index-M_002dn-_0040r_007b_0028Incremental-search_0029_007d-797"></a><a name="index-M_002dp-_0040r_007b_0028Incremental-search_0029_007d-798"></a>  To reuse earlier search strings, use the <dfn>search ring</dfn>.  The
commands <kbd>M-p</kbd> and <kbd>M-n</kbd> move through the ring to pick a
search string to reuse.  These commands leave the selected search ring
element in the minibuffer, where you can edit it.

   <p><a name="index-M_002de-_0040r_007b_0028Incremental-search_0029_007d-799"></a>  To edit the current search string in the minibuffer without
replacing it with items from the search ring, type <kbd>M-e</kbd>.  Type
<kbd>C-s</kbd> or <kbd>C-r</kbd> to finish editing the string and search for it.

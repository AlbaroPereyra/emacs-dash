<h4 class="subsection">48.1.8 Creating Custom Themes</h4>

<p><a name="index-custom-themes_002c-creating-4334"></a>
<a name="index-customize_002dcreate_002dtheme-4335"></a>  You can define a Custom theme using an interface similar to the
customization buffer, by typing <kbd>M-x customize-create-theme</kbd>. 
This switches to a buffer named <samp><span class="file">*Custom Theme*</span></samp>.  It also offers
to insert some common Emacs faces into the theme (a convenience, since
Custom themes are often used to customize faces).  If you answer no,
the theme will initially contain no settings.

   <p>Near the top of the <samp><span class="file">*Custom Theme*</span></samp> buffer are editable fields
where you can enter the theme's name and description.  The name can be
anything except &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">user</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The description is the one that will be
shown when you invoke <kbd>M-x describe-theme</kbd> for the theme.  Its
first line should be a brief one-sentence summary; in the buffer made
by <kbd>M-x customize-themes</kbd>, this sentence is displayed next to the
theme name.

   <p>To add a new setting to the theme, use the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[Insert Additional
Face]</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[Insert Additional Variable]</span></samp>&rsquo; buttons.  Each button
reads a face or variable name using the minibuffer, with completion,
and inserts a customization entry for the face or variable.  You can
edit the variable values or face attributes in the same way as in a
normal customization buffer.  To remove a face or variable from the
theme, uncheck the checkbox next to its name.

   <p><a name="index-custom_002dtheme_002ddirectory-4336"></a>  After specifying the Custom theme's faces and variables, type
<kbd>C-x C-s</kbd> (<code>custom-theme-write</code>) or use the buffer's
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[Save Theme]</span></samp>&rsquo; button.  This saves the theme file, named
<samp><var>name</var><span class="file">-theme.el</span></samp> where <var>name</var> is the theme name, in the
directory named by <code>custom-theme-directory</code>.

   <p>From the <samp><span class="file">*Custom Theme*</span></samp> buffer, you can view and edit an
existing Custom theme by activating the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[Visit Theme]</span></samp>&rsquo; button
and specifying the theme name.  You can also add the settings of
another theme into the buffer, using the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[Merge Theme]</span></samp>&rsquo; button. 
You can import your non-theme settings into a Custom theme by using
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[Merge Theme]</span></samp>&rsquo; button and specifying the special theme named
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">user</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>A theme file is simply an Emacs Lisp source file, and loading the
Custom theme works by loading the Lisp file.  Therefore, you can edit
a theme file directly instead of using the <samp><span class="file">*Custom Theme*</span></samp>
buffer.  See <a href="../elisp/Custom-Themes.html#Custom-Themes">Custom Themes</a>, for details.

<h4 class="subsection">48.3.2 Prefix Keymaps</h4>

<p>Internally, Emacs records only single events in each keymap. 
Interpreting a key sequence of multiple events involves a chain of
keymaps: the first keymap gives a definition for the first event,
which is another keymap, which is used to look up the second event in
the sequence, and so on.  Thus, a prefix key such as <kbd>C-x</kbd> or
&lt;ESC&gt; has its own keymap, which holds the definition for the event
that immediately follows that prefix.

   <p>The definition of a prefix key is usually the keymap to use for
looking up the following event.  The definition can also be a Lisp
symbol whose function definition is the following keymap; the effect is
the same, but it provides a command name for the prefix key that can be
used as a description of what the prefix key is for.  Thus, the binding
of <kbd>C-x</kbd> is the symbol <code>Control-X-prefix</code>, whose function
definition is the keymap for <kbd>C-x</kbd> commands.  The definitions of
<kbd>C-c</kbd>, <kbd>C-x</kbd>, <kbd>C-h</kbd> and &lt;ESC&gt; as prefix keys appear in
the global map, so these prefix keys are always available.

   <p>Aside from ordinary prefix keys, there is a fictitious &ldquo;prefix key&rdquo;
which represents the menu bar; see <a href="../elisp/Menu-Bar.html#Menu-Bar">Menu Bar</a>, for special information about menu bar key bindings. 
Mouse button events that invoke pop-up menus are also prefix keys; see
<a href="../elisp/Menu-Keymaps.html#Menu-Keymaps">Menu Keymaps</a>, for more
details.

   <p>Some prefix keymaps are stored in variables with names:

     <ul>
<li><a name="index-ctl_002dx_002dmap-4384"></a><code>ctl-x-map</code> is the variable name for the map used for characters that
follow <kbd>C-x</kbd>. 
<li><a name="index-help_002dmap-4385"></a><code>help-map</code> is for characters that follow <kbd>C-h</kbd>. 
<li><a name="index-esc_002dmap-4386"></a><code>esc-map</code> is for characters that follow &lt;ESC&gt;.  Thus, all Meta
characters are actually defined by this map. 
<li><a name="index-ctl_002dx_002d4_002dmap-4387"></a><code>ctl-x-4-map</code> is for characters that follow <kbd>C-x 4</kbd>. 
<li><a name="index-mode_002dspecific_002dmap-4388"></a><code>mode-specific-map</code> is for characters that follow <kbd>C-c</kbd>. 
</ul>

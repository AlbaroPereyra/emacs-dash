<h3 class="section">17.2 The Keyboard Macro Ring</h3>

<p>All defined keyboard macros are recorded in the <dfn>keyboard macro
ring</dfn>.  There is only one keyboard macro ring, shared by all buffers.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-x C-k C-k</kbd><dd>Execute the keyboard macro at the head of the ring (<code>kmacro-end-or-call-macro-repeat</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x C-k C-n</kbd><dd>Rotate the keyboard macro ring to the next macro (defined earlier)
(<code>kmacro-cycle-ring-next</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x C-k C-p</kbd><dd>Rotate the keyboard macro ring to the previous macro (defined later)
(<code>kmacro-cycle-ring-previous</code>). 
</dl>

   <p>All commands which operate on the keyboard macro ring use the
same <kbd>C-x C-k</kbd> prefix.  Most of these commands can be executed and
repeated immediately after each other without repeating the <kbd>C-x
C-k</kbd> prefix.  For example,

<pre class="example">     C-x C-k C-p C-p C-k C-k C-k C-n C-n C-k C-p C-k C-d
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">will rotate the keyboard macro ring to the &ldquo;second previous&rdquo; macro,
execute the resulting head macro three times, rotate back to the
original head macro, execute that once, rotate to the &ldquo;previous&rdquo;
macro, execute that, and finally delete it from the macro ring.

   <p><a name="index-kmacro_002dend_002dor_002dcall_002dmacro_002drepeat-945"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002dk-C_002dk-946"></a>  The command <kbd>C-x C-k C-k</kbd> (<code>kmacro-end-or-call-macro-repeat</code>)
executes the keyboard macro at the head of the macro ring.  You can
repeat the macro immediately by typing another <kbd>C-k</kbd>, or you can
rotate the macro ring immediately by typing <kbd>C-n</kbd> or <kbd>C-p</kbd>.

   <p>When a keyboard macro is being defined, <kbd>C-x C-k C-k</kbd> behaves
like &lt;F4&gt; except that, immediately afterward, you can use most key
bindings of this section without the <kbd>C-x C-k</kbd> prefix.  For
instance, another <kbd>C-k</kbd> will re-execute the macro.

   <p><a name="index-kmacro_002dcycle_002dring_002dnext-947"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002dk-C_002dn-948"></a><a name="index-kmacro_002dcycle_002dring_002dprevious-949"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002dk-C_002dp-950"></a>  The commands <kbd>C-x C-k C-n</kbd> (<code>kmacro-cycle-ring-next</code>) and
<kbd>C-x C-k C-p</kbd> (<code>kmacro-cycle-ring-previous</code>) rotate the
macro ring, bringing the next or previous keyboard macro to the head
of the macro ring.  The definition of the new head macro is displayed
in the echo area.  You can continue to rotate the macro ring
immediately by repeating just <kbd>C-n</kbd> and <kbd>C-p</kbd> until the
desired macro is at the head of the ring.  To execute the new macro
ring head immediately, just type <kbd>C-k</kbd>.

   <p>Note that Emacs treats the head of the macro ring as the &ldquo;last
defined keyboard macro&rdquo;.  For instance, &lt;F4&gt; will execute that
macro, and <kbd>C-x C-k n</kbd> will give it a name.

   <p><a name="index-kmacro_002dring_002dmax-951"></a>  The maximum number of macros stored in the keyboard macro ring is
determined by the customizable variable <code>kmacro-ring-max</code>.

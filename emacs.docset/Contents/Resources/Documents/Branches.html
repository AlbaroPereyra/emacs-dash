<h4 class="subsection">28.1.10 Version Control Branches</h4>

<p><a name="index-branch-_0028version-control_0029-2806"></a>
  One use of version control is to support multiple independent lines
of development, which are called <dfn>branches</dfn>.  Branches are used
for maintaining separate &ldquo;stable&rdquo; and &ldquo;development&rdquo; versions of a
program, and for developing unrelated features in isolation from one
another.

   <p>VC's support for branch operations is currently fairly limited.  For
decentralized version control systems, it provides commands for
<dfn>updating</dfn> one branch with the contents of another, and for
<dfn>merging</dfn> the changes made to two different branches
(see <a href="Merging.html#Merging">Merging</a>).  For centralized version control systems, it
supports checking out different branches and committing into new or
different branches.

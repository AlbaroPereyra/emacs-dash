<h3 class="section">50.2 Recursive Editing Levels</h3>

<p>Recursive editing levels are important and useful features of Emacs, but
they can seem like malfunctions if you do not understand them.

   <p>If the mode line has square brackets &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[...]</span></samp>&rsquo; around the
parentheses that contain the names of the major and minor modes, you
have entered a recursive editing level.  If you did not do this on
purpose, or if you don't understand what that means, you should just
get out of the recursive editing level.  To do so, type <kbd>M-x
top-level</kbd>.  See <a href="Recursive-Edit.html#Recursive-Edit">Recursive Edit</a>.

<h3 class="section">7.11 Repeating a Command</h3>

<p><a name="index-repeating-a-command-166"></a>
  Many simple commands, such as those invoked with a single key or
with <kbd>M-x </kbd><var>command-name</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>, can be repeated by
invoking them with a numeric argument that serves as a repeat count
(see <a href="Arguments.html#Arguments">Arguments</a>).  However, if the command you want to repeat
prompts for input, or uses a numeric argument in another way, that
method won't work.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-z-167"></a><a name="index-repeat-168"></a>  The command <kbd>C-x z</kbd> (<code>repeat</code>) provides another way to repeat
an Emacs command many times.  This command repeats the previous Emacs
command, whatever that was.  Repeating a command uses the same arguments
that were used before; it does not read new arguments each time.

   <p>To repeat the command more than once, type additional <kbd>z</kbd>'s: each
<kbd>z</kbd> repeats the command one more time.  Repetition ends when you
type a character other than <kbd>z</kbd>, or press a mouse button.

   <p>For example, suppose you type <kbd>C-u 2 0 C-d</kbd> to delete 20
characters.  You can repeat that command (including its argument) three
additional times, to delete a total of 80 characters, by typing <kbd>C-x
z z z</kbd>.  The first <kbd>C-x z</kbd> repeats the command once, and each
subsequent <kbd>z</kbd> repeats it once again.

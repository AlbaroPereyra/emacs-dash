<h4 class="subsection">48.3.9 Named <acronym>ASCII</acronym> Control Characters</h4>

<p>&lt;TAB&gt;, &lt;RET&gt;, &lt;BS&gt;, &lt;LFD&gt;, &lt;ESC&gt; and &lt;DEL&gt;
started out as names for certain <acronym>ASCII</acronym> control characters,
used so often that they have special keys of their own.  For instance,
&lt;TAB&gt; was another name for <kbd>C-i</kbd>.  Later, users found it
convenient to distinguish in Emacs between these keys and the &ldquo;same&rdquo;
control characters typed with the &lt;CTRL&gt; key.  Therefore, on most
modern terminals, they are no longer the same: &lt;TAB&gt; is different
from <kbd>C-i</kbd>.

   <p>Emacs can distinguish these two kinds of input if the keyboard does. 
It treats the &ldquo;special&rdquo; keys as function keys named <code>tab</code>,
<code>return</code>, <code>backspace</code>, <code>linefeed</code>, <code>escape</code>, and
<code>delete</code>.  These function keys translate automatically into the
corresponding <acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters <em>if</em> they have no
bindings of their own.  As a result, neither users nor Lisp programs
need to pay attention to the distinction unless they care to.

   <p>If you do not want to distinguish between (for example) &lt;TAB&gt; and
<kbd>C-i</kbd>, make just one binding, for the <acronym>ASCII</acronym> character &lt;TAB&gt;
(octal code 011).  If you do want to distinguish, make one binding for
this <acronym>ASCII</acronym> character, and another for the &ldquo;function key&rdquo; <code>tab</code>.

   <p>With an ordinary <acronym>ASCII</acronym> terminal, there is no way to distinguish
between &lt;TAB&gt; and <kbd>C-i</kbd> (and likewise for other such pairs),
because the terminal sends the same character in both cases.

<h4 class="subsection">28.2.2 Format of ChangeLog</h4>

<p>A change log entry starts with a header line that contains the
current date, your name (taken from the variable
<code>add-log-full-name</code>), and your email address (taken from the
variable <code>add-log-mailing-address</code>).  Aside from these header
lines, every line in the change log starts with a space or a tab.  The
bulk of the entry consists of <dfn>items</dfn>, each of which starts with a
line starting with whitespace and a star.  Here are two entries, both
dated in May 1993, with two items and one item respectively.

<pre class="smallexample">     1993-05-25  Richard Stallman  &lt;rms@gnu.org&gt;
     
             * man.el: Rename symbols `man-*' to `Man-*'.
             (manual-entry): Make prompt string clearer.
     
             * simple.el (blink-matching-paren-distance):
             Change default to 12,000.
     
     1993-05-24  Richard Stallman  &lt;rms@gnu.org&gt;
     
             * vc.el (minor-mode-map-alist): Don't use it if it's void.
             (vc-cancel-version): Doc fix.
</pre>
   <p>One entry can describe several changes; each change should have its
own item, or its own line in an item.  Normally there should be a
blank line between items.  When items are related (parts of the same
change, in different places), group them by leaving no blank line
between them.

   <p>You should put a copyright notice and permission notice at the
end of the change log file.  Here is an example:

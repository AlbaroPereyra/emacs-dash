<h3 class="section">14.14 Window Fringes</h3>

<p><a name="index-fringes-678"></a>
<a name="index-set_002dfringe_002dstyle-679"></a><a name="index-fringe_002dmode-680"></a>  On graphical displays, each Emacs window normally has narrow
<dfn>fringes</dfn> on the left and right edges.  The fringes are used to
display symbols that provide information about the text in the window. 
You can type <kbd>M-x fringe-mode</kbd> to disable the fringes, or modify
their width.  This command affects fringes in all frames; to modify
fringes on the selected frame only, use <kbd>M-x set-fringe-style</kbd>.

   <p>The most common use of the fringes is to indicate a continuation
line (see <a href="Continuation-Lines.html#Continuation-Lines">Continuation Lines</a>).  When one line of text is split
into multiple screen lines, the left fringe shows a curving arrow for
each screen line except the first, indicating that &ldquo;this is not the
real beginning&rdquo;.  The right fringe shows a curving arrow for each
screen line except the last, indicating that &ldquo;this is not the real
end&rdquo;.  If the line's direction is right-to-left (see <a href="Bidirectional-Editing.html#Bidirectional-Editing">Bidirectional Editing</a>), the meanings of the curving arrows in the fringes are
swapped.

   <p>The fringes indicate line truncation with short horizontal arrows
meaning &ldquo;there's more text on this line which is scrolled
horizontally out of view&rdquo;.  Clicking the mouse on one of the arrows
scrolls the display horizontally in the direction of the arrow.

   <p>The fringes can also indicate other things, such as buffer
boundaries (see <a href="Displaying-Boundaries.html#Displaying-Boundaries">Displaying Boundaries</a>), and where a program you
are debugging is executing (see <a href="Debuggers.html#Debuggers">Debuggers</a>).

   <p><a name="index-overflow_002dnewline_002dinto_002dfringe-681"></a>  The fringe is also used for drawing the cursor, if the current line
is exactly as wide as the window and point is at the end of the line. 
To disable this, change the variable
<code>overflow-newline-into-fringe</code> to <code>nil</code>; this causes Emacs
to continue or truncate lines that are exactly as wide as the window.

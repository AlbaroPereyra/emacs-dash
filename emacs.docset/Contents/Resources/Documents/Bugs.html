<h2 class="chapter">51 Reporting Bugs</h2>

<p><a name="index-bugs-4468"></a>  If you think you have found a bug in Emacs, please report it.  We
cannot promise to fix it, or always to agree that it is a bug, but we
certainly want to hear about it.  The same applies for new features
you would like to see added.  The following sections will help you to
construct an effective bug report.

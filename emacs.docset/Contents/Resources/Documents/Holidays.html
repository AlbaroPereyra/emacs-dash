<h3 class="section">31.6 Holidays</h3>

<p><a name="index-holidays-3285"></a>
  The Emacs calendar knows about many major and minor holidays,
and can display them.  You can add your own holidays to the default list.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>Mouse-3 Holidays</kbd><dt><kbd>h</kbd><dd>Display holidays for the selected date
(<code>calendar-cursor-holidays</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>x</kbd><dd>Mark holidays in the calendar window (<code>calendar-mark-holidays</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>u</kbd><dd>Unmark calendar window (<code>calendar-unmark</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>a</kbd><dd>List all holidays for the displayed three months in another window
(<code>calendar-list-holidays</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x holidays</kbd><dd>List all holidays for three months around today's date in another
window. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x list-holidays</kbd><dd>List holidays in another window for a specified range of years. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-h-_0040r_007b_0028Calendar-mode_0029_007d-3286"></a><a name="index-calendar_002dcursor_002dholidays-3287"></a><a name="index-calendar_002dview_002dholidays_002dinitially_002dflag-3288"></a>  To see if any holidays fall on a given date, position point on that
date in the calendar window and use the <kbd>h</kbd> command.  Alternatively,
click on that date with <kbd>Mouse-3</kbd> and then choose <kbd>Holidays</kbd>
from the menu that appears.  Either way, this displays the holidays for
that date, in the echo area if they fit there, otherwise in a separate
window.

   <p><a name="index-x-_0040r_007b_0028Calendar-mode_0029_007d-3289"></a><a name="index-calendar_002dmark_002dholidays-3290"></a><a name="index-u-_0040r_007b_0028Calendar-mode_0029_007d-3291"></a><a name="index-calendar_002dunmark-3292"></a><a name="index-calendar_002dmark_002dholidays_002dflag-3293"></a>  To view the distribution of holidays for all the dates shown in the
calendar, use the <kbd>x</kbd> command.  This displays the dates that are
holidays in a different face. 
See <a href="Calendar-Customizing.html#Calendar-Customizing">calendar-holiday-marker</a>. 
  The command applies both to the currently visible months and to
other months that subsequently become visible by scrolling.  To turn
marking off and erase the current marks, type <kbd>u</kbd>, which also
erases any diary marks (see <a href="Diary.html#Diary">Diary</a>).  If the variable
<code>calendar-mark-holidays-flag</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, creating or
updating the calendar marks holidays automatically.

   <p><a name="index-a-_0040r_007b_0028Calendar-mode_0029_007d-3294"></a><a name="index-calendar_002dlist_002dholidays-3295"></a>  To get even more detailed information, use the <kbd>a</kbd> command, which
displays a separate buffer containing a list of all holidays in the
current three-month range.  You can use &lt;SPC&gt; and &lt;DEL&gt; in the
calendar window to scroll that list up and down, respectively.

   <p><a name="index-holidays-3296"></a>  The command <kbd>M-x holidays</kbd> displays the list of holidays for the
current month and the preceding and succeeding months; this works even
if you don't have a calendar window.  If the variable
<code>calendar-view-holidays-initially-flag</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, creating
the calendar displays holidays in this way.  If you want the list of
holidays centered around a different month, use <kbd>C-u M-x
holidays</kbd>, which prompts for the month and year.

   <p>The holidays known to Emacs include United States holidays and the
major Bahá'í, Chinese, Christian, Islamic, and Jewish holidays; also the
solstices and equinoxes.

   <p><a name="index-list_002dholidays-3297"></a>   The command <kbd>M-x holiday-list</kbd> displays the list of holidays for
a range of years.  This function asks you for the starting and stopping
years, and allows you to choose all the holidays or one of several
categories of holidays.  You can use this command even if you don't have
a calendar window.

   <p>The dates used by Emacs for holidays are based on <em>current
practice</em>, not historical fact.  For example Veteran's Day began in
1919, but is shown in earlier years.

<p><a name="index-digest-message-3781"></a><a name="index-undigestify-3782"></a>
  A <dfn>digest message</dfn> is a message which exists to contain and carry
several other messages.  Digests are used on some mailing
lists; all the messages that arrive for the list during a period of time
such as one day are put inside a single digest which is then sent to the
subscribers.  Transmitting the single digest uses less computer
time than transmitting the individual messages even though the total
size is the same, because of the per-message overhead in network mail
transmission.

   <p><a name="index-undigestify_002drmail_002dmessage-3783"></a>  When you receive a digest message, the most convenient way to read it is
to <dfn>undigestify</dfn> it: to turn it back into many individual messages. 
Then you can read and delete the individual messages as it suits you. 
To do this, select the digest message and type the command <kbd>M-x
undigestify-rmail-message</kbd>.  This extracts the submessages as separate
Rmail messages, and inserts them following the digest.  The digest
message itself is flagged as deleted.

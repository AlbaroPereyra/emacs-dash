<h3 class="section">34.2 When Gnus Starts Up</h3>

<p><a name="index-gnus-3802"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040file_007b_002enewsrc_007d-file-3803"></a>  If your system has been set up for reading Usenet news, getting
started with Gnus is easy&mdash;just type <kbd>M-x gnus</kbd>.

   <p>On starting up, Gnus reads your <dfn>news initialization file</dfn>: a
file named <samp><span class="file">.newsrc</span></samp> in your home directory which lists your
Usenet newsgroups and subscriptions (this file is not unique to Gnus;
it is used by many other newsreader programs).  It then tries to
contact the system's default news server, which is typically specified
by the <samp><span class="env">NNTPSERVER</span></samp> environment variable.

   <p>If your system does not have a default news server, or if you wish
to use Gnus for reading email, then before invoking <kbd>M-x gnus</kbd> you
need to tell Gnus where to get news and/or mail.  To do this,
customize the variables <code>gnus-select-method</code> and/or
<code>gnus-secondary-select-methods</code>. 
See <a href="../gnus/Finding-the-News.html#Finding-the-News">Finding the News</a>.

   <p>Once Gnus has started up, it displays the group buffer.  By default,
the group buffer shows only a small number of <dfn>subscribed groups</dfn>. 
Groups with other statuses&mdash;<dfn>unsubscribed</dfn>, <dfn>killed</dfn>, or
<dfn>zombie</dfn>&mdash;are hidden.  The first time you start Gnus, any group
to which you are not subscribed is made into a killed group; any group
that subsequently appears on the news server becomes a zombie group.

   <p>To proceed, you must select a group in the group buffer to open the
summary buffer for that group; then, select an article in the summary
buffer to view its article buffer in a separate window.  The following
sections explain how to use the group and summary buffers to do this.

   <p>To quit Gnus, type <kbd>q</kbd> in the group buffer.  This automatically
records your group statuses in the files <samp><span class="file">.newsrc</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="file">.newsrc.eld</span></samp>, so that they take effect in subsequent Gnus
sessions.

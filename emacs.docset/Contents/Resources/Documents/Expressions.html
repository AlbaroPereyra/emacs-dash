<h4 class="subsection">26.4.1 Expressions with Balanced Parentheses</h4>

<p><a name="index-sexp-2276"></a><a name="index-expression-2277"></a><a name="index-balanced-expression-2278"></a>  Each programming language mode has its own definition of a
<dfn>balanced expression</dfn>.  Balanced expressions typically include
individual symbols, numbers, and string constants, as well as pieces
of code enclosed in a matching pair of delimiters.  The following
commands deal with balanced expressions (in Emacs, such expressions
are referred to internally as <dfn>sexps</dfn><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>).

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-M-f</kbd><dd>Move forward over a balanced expression (<code>forward-sexp</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-M-b</kbd><dd>Move backward over a balanced expression (<code>backward-sexp</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-M-k</kbd><dd>Kill balanced expression forward (<code>kill-sexp</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-M-t</kbd><dd>Transpose expressions (<code>transpose-sexps</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-M-@</kbd><dt><kbd>C-M-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd><dd>Put mark after following expression (<code>mark-sexp</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-C_002dM_002df-2279"></a><a name="index-C_002dM_002db-2280"></a><a name="index-forward_002dsexp-2281"></a><a name="index-backward_002dsexp-2282"></a>  To move forward over a balanced expression, use <kbd>C-M-f</kbd>
(<code>forward-sexp</code>).  If the first significant character after point
is an opening delimiter (e.g., &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">{</span></samp>&rsquo; in C),
this command moves past the matching closing delimiter.  If the
character begins a symbol, string, or number, the command moves over
that.

   <p>The command <kbd>C-M-b</kbd> (<code>backward-sexp</code>) moves backward over a
balanced expression&mdash;like <kbd>C-M-f</kbd>, but in the reverse direction. 
If the expression is preceded by any prefix characters (single-quote,
backquote and comma, in Lisp), the command moves back over them as
well.

   <p><kbd>C-M-f</kbd> or <kbd>C-M-b</kbd> with an argument repeats that operation
the specified number of times; with a negative argument means to move
in the opposite direction.  In most modes, these two commands move
across comments as if they were whitespace.  Note that their keys,
<kbd>C-M-f</kbd> and <kbd>C-M-b</kbd>, are analogous to <kbd>C-f</kbd> and <kbd>C-b</kbd>,
which move by characters (see <a href="Moving-Point.html#Moving-Point">Moving Point</a>), and <kbd>M-f</kbd> and
<kbd>M-b</kbd>, which move by words (see <a href="Words.html#Words">Words</a>).

   <p><a name="index-killing-expressions-2283"></a><a name="index-C_002dM_002dk-2284"></a><a name="index-kill_002dsexp-2285"></a>  To kill a whole balanced expression, type <kbd>C-M-k</kbd>
(<code>kill-sexp</code>).  This kills the text that <kbd>C-M-f</kbd> would move
over.

   <p><a name="index-transposition-of-expressions-2286"></a><a name="index-C_002dM_002dt-2287"></a><a name="index-transpose_002dsexps-2288"></a>  <kbd>C-M-t</kbd> (<code>transpose-sexps</code>) switches the positions of the
previous balanced expression and the next one.  It is analogous to the
<kbd>C-t</kbd> command, which transposes characters (see <a href="Transpose.html#Transpose">Transpose</a>). 
An argument to <kbd>C-M-t</kbd> serves as a repeat count, moving the
previous expression over that many following ones.  A negative
argument moves the previous balanced expression backwards across those
before it.  An argument of zero, rather than doing nothing, transposes
the balanced expressions ending at or after point and the mark.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dM_002d_0040_0040-2289"></a><a name="index-C_002dM_002d_0040key_007bSPC_007d-2290"></a><a name="index-mark_002dsexp-2291"></a>  To operate on balanced expressions with a command which acts on the
region, type <kbd>C-M-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> (<code>mark-sexp</code>).  This sets the
mark where <kbd>C-M-f</kbd> would move to.  While the mark is active, each
successive call to this command extends the region by shifting the
mark by one expression.  Positive or negative numeric arguments move
the mark forward or backward by the specified number of expressions. 
The alias <kbd>C-M-@</kbd> is equivalent to <kbd>C-M-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>. 
See <a href="Marking-Objects.html#Marking-Objects">Marking Objects</a>, for more information about this and related
commands.

   <p>In languages that use infix operators, such as C, it is not possible
to recognize all balanced expressions because there can be multiple
possibilities at a given position.  For example, C mode does not treat
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo + bar</span></samp>&rsquo; as a single expression, even though it <em>is</em> one
C expression; instead, it recognizes &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>&rsquo; as one expression and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">bar</span></samp>&rsquo; as another, with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; as punctuation between them. 
However, C mode recognizes &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(foo + bar)</span></samp>&rsquo; as a single expression,
because of the parentheses.

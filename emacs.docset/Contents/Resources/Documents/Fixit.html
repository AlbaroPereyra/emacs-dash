<h2 class="chapter">16 Commands for Fixing Typos</h2>

<p><a name="index-typos_002c-fixing-885"></a><a name="index-mistakes_002c-correcting-886"></a>
  In this chapter we describe commands that are useful when you catch
a mistake while editing.  The most fundamental of these commands is
the undo command <kbd>C-/</kbd> (also bound to <kbd>C-x u</kbd> and <kbd>C-_</kbd>). 
This undoes a single command, or a
part of a command (as in the case of <code>query-replace</code>), or several
consecutive character insertions.  Consecutive repetitions of
<kbd>C-/</kbd> undo earlier and earlier changes, back to the limit of the
undo information available.

   <p>Aside from the commands described here, you can erase text using
deletion commands such as &lt;DEL&gt; (<code>delete-backward-char</code>). 
These were described earlier in this manual.  See <a href="Erasing.html#Erasing">Erasing</a>.

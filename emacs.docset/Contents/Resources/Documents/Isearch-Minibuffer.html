<h4 class="subsection">15.1.7 Searching the Minibuffer</h4>

<p><a name="index-minibuffer-history_002c-searching-825"></a>
If you start an incremental search while the minibuffer is active,
Emacs searches the contents of the minibuffer.  Unlike searching an
ordinary buffer, the search string is not shown in the echo area,
because that is used to display the minibuffer.

   <p>If an incremental search fails in the minibuffer, it tries searching
the minibuffer history.  See <a href="Minibuffer-History.html#Minibuffer-History">Minibuffer History</a>.  You can visualize
the minibuffer and its history as a series of &ldquo;pages&rdquo;, with the
earliest history element on the first page and the current minibuffer
on the last page.  A forward search, <kbd>C-s</kbd>, searches forward to
later pages; a reverse search, <kbd>C-r</kbd>, searches backwards to
earlier pages.  Like in ordinary buffer search, a failing search can
wrap around, going from the last page to the first page or vice versa.

   <p>When the current match is on a history element, that history element
is pulled into the minibuffer.  If you exit the incremental search
normally (e.g., by typing &lt;RET&gt;), it remains in the minibuffer
afterwards.  Canceling the search, with <kbd>C-g</kbd>, restores the
contents of the minibuffer when you began the search.

<h3 class="section">32.1 The Format of the Mail Buffer</h3>

<p>Here is an example of the contents of a mail buffer:

<pre class="example">     To: subotai@example.org
     CC: mongol.soldier@example.net, rms@gnu.org
     Subject: Re: What is best in life?
     From: conan@example.org
     --text follows this line--
     To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and to
     hear the lamentation of their women.
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">At the top of the mail buffer is a set of <dfn>header fields</dfn>, which
are used for specifying information about the email's recipient(s),
subject, and so on.  The above buffer contains header fields for
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">To</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Cc</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Subject</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">From</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Some header
fields are automatically pre-initialized in the mail buffer, when
appropriate.

   <p>The line that says &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--text follows this line--</span></samp>&rsquo; separates the
header fields from the <dfn>body</dfn> (or <dfn>text</dfn>) of the message. 
Everything above that line is treated as part of the headers;
everything below it is treated as the body.  The delimiter line itself
does not appear in the message actually sent.

   <p>You can insert and edit header fields using ordinary editing
commands.  See <a href="Header-Editing.html#Header-Editing">Header Editing</a>, for commands specific to editing
header fields.  Certain headers, such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Date</span></samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Message-Id</span></samp>&rsquo;, are normally omitted from the mail buffer and are
created automatically when the message is sent.

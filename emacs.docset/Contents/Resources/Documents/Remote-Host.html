  You can login to a remote computer, using whatever commands you
would from a regular terminal (e.g., using the <code>telnet</code> or
<code>rlogin</code> commands), from a Term window.

   <p>A program that asks you for a password will normally suppress
echoing of the password, so the password will not show up in the
buffer.  This will happen just as if you were using a real terminal,
if the buffer is in char mode.  If it is in line mode, the password is
temporarily visible, but will be erased when you hit return.  (This
happens automatically; there is no special password processing.)

   <p>When you log in to a different machine, you need to specify the type
of terminal you're using, by setting the <samp><span class="env">TERM</span></samp> environment
variable in the environment for the remote login command.  (If you use
bash, you do that by writing the variable assignment before the remote
login command, without a separating comma.)  Terminal types
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ansi</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">vt100</span></samp>&rsquo; will work on most systems.

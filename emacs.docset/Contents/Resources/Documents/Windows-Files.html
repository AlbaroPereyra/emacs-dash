<h3 class="section">G.3 File Names on MS-Windows</h3>

<p><a name="index-file-names-on-MS_002dWindows-4703"></a>
  MS-Windows and MS-DOS normally use a backslash, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo;, to
separate name units within a file name, instead of the slash used on
other systems.  Emacs on MS-DOS/MS-Windows permits use of either slash or
backslash, and also knows about drive letters in file names.

   <p><a name="index-file_002dname-completion_002c-on-MS_002dWindows-4704"></a>  On MS-DOS/MS-Windows, file names are case-insensitive, so Emacs by
default ignores letter-case in file names during completion.

   <p><a name="index-w32_002dget_002dtrue_002dfile_002dattributes-4705"></a>  The variable <code>w32-get-true-file-attributes</code> controls whether
Emacs should issue additional system calls to determine more
accurately file attributes in primitives like <code>file-attributes</code>
and <code>directory-files-and-attributes</code>.  These additional calls are
needed to report correct file ownership, link counts and file types
for special files such as pipes.  Without these system calls, file
ownership will be attributed to the current user, link counts will be
always reported as 1, and special files will be reported as regular
files.

   <p>If the value of this variable is <code>local</code> (the default), Emacs
will issue these additional system calls only for files on local fixed
drives.  Any other non-<code>nil</code> value means do this even for
removable and remote volumes, where this could potentially slow down
Dired and other related features.  The value of <code>nil</code> means never
issue those system calls.  Non-<code>nil</code> values are more useful on
NTFS volumes, which support hard links and file security, than on FAT,
FAT32, and XFAT volumes.

<h3 class="section">21.2 Mouse Commands for Words and Lines</h3>

<p>These variants of <kbd>Mouse-1</kbd> select entire words or lines at a
time.  Emacs activates the region around the selected text, which is
also copied to the kill ring.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>Double-Mouse-1</kbd><dd>Select the text around the word which you click on.

     <p>Double-clicking on a character with &ldquo;symbol&rdquo; syntax (such as
underscore, in C mode) selects the symbol surrounding that character. 
Double-clicking on a character with open- or close-parenthesis syntax
selects the parenthetical grouping which that character starts or
ends.  Double-clicking on a character with string-delimiter syntax
(such as a single-quote or double-quote in C) selects the string
constant (Emacs uses heuristics to figure out whether that character
is the beginning or the end of it).

     <br><dt><kbd>Double-Drag-Mouse-1</kbd><dd>Select the text you drag across, in the form of whole words.

     <br><dt><kbd>Triple-Mouse-1</kbd><dd>Select the line you click on.

     <br><dt><kbd>Triple-Drag-Mouse-1</kbd><dd>Select the text you drag across, in the form of whole lines.

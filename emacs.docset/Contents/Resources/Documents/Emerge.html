  It's not unusual for programmers to get their signals crossed and
modify the same program in two different directions.  To recover from
this confusion, you need to merge the two versions.  Emerge makes this
easier.  For other ways to compare files, see
<a href="Comparing-Files.html#Comparing-Files">Comparing Files</a>,
and <a href="../ediff/index.html#Top">Ediff</a>.
